  <h1>Tyrannosaurus rex</h1>
  <img alt="image of t-rex">
  <p>Roaming the landscapes of North America, the Tyrannosaurus rex, often abbreviated as T. rex, 
    is a colossal carnivorous dinosaur distinguished by its massive head, razor-sharp teeth, and strong, 
    muscular legs. While its tiny arms may seem incongruous given its size, they are incredibly robust. 
    This apex predator, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, is a dominant figure in ancient 
    ecosystems and stands as a testament to the raw power of prehistoric life.</p>
