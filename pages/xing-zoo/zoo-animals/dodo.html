  <h1>Dodo Bird</h1>
  <img alt="image of dodo">
  <p>Native to the island of Mauritius, the dodo bird is a distinct, flightless bird characterized by its robust build, 
    large head, bulbous-tipped beak, and stubby wings. Standing about a meter tall, this unique avian primarily feeds on fruits and seeds.
     Discovered by Dutch sailors in 1598, the dodo's lack of natural predators on its home island has led to its evolution as a flightless
      species, making it a fascinating study of island biogeography and adaptation.</p>
