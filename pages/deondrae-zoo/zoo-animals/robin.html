    The robin bird, a cherished symbol of new beginnings, graces gardens with its reddish-orange breast. Known for its
    sweet, melodious song, it announces the arrival of each day. As a year-round resident or migratory visitor, the
    robin's presence heralds the changing seasons and inspires hope in nature's rhythm.
