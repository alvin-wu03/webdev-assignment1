        <h2>About the Flying Bison</h2>
        <!--Paragraph taken from https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Flying_bison-->
        <p>Flying bison have five stomachs, flat manatee-like tails, brown eyes, shaggy white fur, and a brown arrow that runs along 
            their back from tail-tip to forehead. They have six legs with three toes on each foot. Each toe has three knuckles allowing 
            the feet to act as rudimentary hands, with enough dexterity for the average bison to grasp an adult human without harming them. 
            A concern for human companions when grooming their bison is making sure to clean any mud and insects out from between the toes. 
            As they are primarily herbivores, flying bison have flat teeth shaped like peanuts, which are spread out on the roof and bottom 
            of the mouth in groups of ten. From a young age, flying bison possess two pointed horns on their heads that are initially short 
            and blunt but grow in length as they grow older.</p>
