        The Phoenix, a mythical bird in various cultures, is a symbol of rebirth and immortality. It's depicted as a
        radiant bird that rises from its ashes after death, signifying renewal and hope. In One Piece, Marco's Phoenix
        Zoan fruit grants him this mythical bird's abilities, allowing him to heal rapidly and rise again even after
        serious injuries.
