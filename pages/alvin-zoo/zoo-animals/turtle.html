      Turtles are reptiles characterized by their distinct bony or cartilaginous shell, which provides them with protective armor. They inhabit a wide range of environments, from oceans and freshwater bodies to terrestrial habitats. Turtles are known for their slow and steady movement on land and their graceful swimming in water. They have adapted to various lifestyles and diets, with differences in species ranging from herbivorous to carnivorous. Turtles play essential ecological roles as both predators and prey, contributing to the balance of their ecosystems. Some species are also popular as pets, though many are protected due to conservation concerns stemming from habitat loss, pollution, and overexploitation.
