    <p>Dwelling in the world's oceans, the Megalodon is a gigantic prehistoric shark, 
      rivaling modern whales in size. With teeth that can be over 7 inches in length, 
      it's believed to be one of the largest and most powerful predators in vertebrate history. 
      This marine giant, which existed from the early Miocene to the end of the Pliocene, holds a 
      formidable place in the annals of ancient marine life.</p>
