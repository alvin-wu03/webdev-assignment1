  <h1>Woolly Mammoth</h1>
  <img alt="image of mammoth">
  <p>Grazing the icy tundras of the Northern Hemisphere, the woolly mammoth is a majestic, 
    prehistoric relative of the modern elephant. Recognized by its thick, shaggy hair, curved 
    tusks that can span several meters, and a pronounced hump of fat behind its head, this herbivore 
    is supremely adapted to cold environments. A staple in the Ice Age ecosystems, it interacts with 
    other megafauna, playing a vital role in shaping its environment.</p>
