      Jellyfish, fascinating marine creatures, belong to the phylum Cnidaria and are known for their gelatinous, translucent bodies and distinctive bell-like shape. They are found in oceans worldwide, varying in size from tiny, nearly invisible species to larger forms with flowing tentacles. Jellyfish exhibit a simple life cycle, with some species going through stages of polyps and medusae. They move by pulsating their bell-shaped bodies, allowing them to drift with ocean currents. Possessing specialized stinging cells called cnidocytes, they use these to capture prey and defend against predators. While their sting can be painful to humans, jellyfish serve as a crucial part of marine ecosystems, both as prey for various marine creatures and as predators themselves, controlling populations of smaller marine organisms. Their population dynamics can also be influenced by factors like climate change and human activity.
